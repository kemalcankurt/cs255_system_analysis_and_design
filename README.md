Better driver education and test preparation are the goals of this business. The local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) administers the driving test. Liam, the business owner, needs the system to manage many facets of their business, such as online classes, practice exams, scheduling driving lessons, tracking reservations, managing user accounts, and preserving current DMV data. 

I was particularly confident in understanding the business requirements.

If I had to choose a part of the work that I wanted to revise, that would be creating more detailed UML sequence diagrams. Although one sequence diagram was sufficient to complete the assignment, I would have preferred creating multiple or more detailed ones, especially for a professional project.

I interpreted the user needs by envisioning similar systems to DriverPass. For instance, some part of the system has a lot of similarities with any other learning management systems. However, the essential difference is the sources are limited, such as instructors and cars. Therefore, users need to wait for the demanded session if there is no availability.

Gathering and analyzing stakeholder requirements would be my first step. Understanding the needs and anticipated system capabilities is necessary for this approach. It is possible to collect particular requirements using methods like interviews. To further confirm that every step is in line with the needs of the business, I would do early demos.
